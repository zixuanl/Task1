#       charlie shows 100
# 2. charlie multicasts to group1:

#       bob delays (C) then drop (A)
#       charlie shows 101
# 3. alice multicasts to group1:
#       alice shows 201
#       bob drops (A) then shows 100 101 201, all from charlie
#           // because delay rules no more valid at seqNum == 3
